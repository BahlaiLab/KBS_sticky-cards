## Adapting to changing methodology in a long-term experiment

---
## Abstract
### Long-term experiments are critical for understanding ecological processes, but their management comes with unique challenges. As time passes, projects may encounter unavoidable changes due to external factors, like availability of materials, affecting aspects of their research methodology. At the Kellogg Biological Station Long-Term Ecological Research Site, one of many National Science Foundation-funded long-term research stations, a three-decade project recently experienced a supply-chain-induced change in insect sampling methodology in their lady beetle observation study. Since 1989, lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) have been sampled weekly over the growing season using yellow sticky cards. In 2021, the original sticky traps were discontinued by the manufacturer and replaced with a similar, but not identical trap.  We conducted a 3-year study while the new traps were phased in to examine how the trap change would impact the observed biodiversity patterns at the site. We examined community metrics and individual taxa captures to examine within year and between year differences in performance between the card types. Overall, we noted several small but statistically detectible differences in capture patterns between the two trap types. After accounting for other sources of variation, we observed a difference in Shannon diversity of insects captured on the two card types, but not richness or abundance, in the overall insect community. Yet, these differences were dwarfed by the magnitude of difference observed between years within card types. For individual taxa, similar patterns held: between trap differences could be detected statistically, but the number of differences between capture rates of traps was less than the number of differences observed for the same trap, between years. Thus, we conclude that even subtle changes in methodology could impact data produced in long-term experiments moving forward, but in this case the magnitude of this change is smaller than other factors such as time and plant treatment. However, if sustained changes in the capture rates of focal taxa are observed, future scientists may use our observations to specifically quantify and correct for these shifting patterns related to the protocol change.

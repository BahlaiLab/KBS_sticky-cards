## Adapting to changing methodology in a long-term experiment

---
## Abstract
### Long-term experiments are important for ecological monitoring but come with unique challenges. Due to the length of time spanned by this research approach, a project can see changes of personnel or funding, and even changes to sampling protocols due to availability of materials or changes to the environment being studied. Yet, some measurements are not robust to even slight changes, for instance insect monitoring is notoriously sensitive to changes in protocol. At the Kellogg Biological Station Long-Term Ecological Research Site (KBS LTER), one of many NSF-funded long-term research stations, an over 30-year-old project recently experienced a supply-chain-induced change in insect sampling methodology. Since 1989, lady beetles have been sampled weekly over the growing season using yellow sticky cards. In 2021 the supplier discontinued the cards in use since the study was initiated. While a similar sticky card was identified to replace the former standard, they were not identical to the previous. In 2021 we conducted a field study which paired the legacy sticky cards with the new model to examine if this change would impact the observed biodiversity patterns at the site, while otherwise maintaining identical protocol. The study was conducted with standard protocol in 2020 using entirely old cards and in 2022 using entirely new cards. We completed whole community and individual taxa analyzes to examine within-year differences in performance between the card types, adding additional taxa identified in the lab to increase comparisons between the two card types. Identical analyses to assess typical between-year variation for each card type separately were conducted. Once variation by plant treatment was accounted for, there was a difference in Shannon diversity, but not richness or abundance in the overall insect community between the two trap types in 2021. There were differences for all metrics examined in the insect community on the same sticky card types between years, except richness on the new cards. For all comparisons, some statistical differences between the trap types were observed when data was examined by taxon. However, the number of differences between card types was less in number and generally in magnitude than the difference observed on the same card types between sampling years. Thus, we attribute these apparent differences in trap performance for certain taxa to chance: rare events are often ‘significant’ even when population-level effects are minimal. However, we did note different trapping rates of several taxa outside the normal sampling protocol of the legacy experiment, indicating detectable differences do exist between the two card types. If sustained changes in the capture rates of focal taxa are observed, future scientists may use our observations to specifically quantify and correct for these discrepancies related to the protocol change.
